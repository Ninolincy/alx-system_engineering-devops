Write a Python script that, using this REST API, for a given employee ID, returns information about his/her TODO list progress.

Requirements:

You must use urllib or requests module
The script must accept an integer as a parameter, which is the employee ID
The script must display on the standard output the employee TODO list progress in this exact format:
First line: Employee EMPLOYEE_NAME is done with tasks(NUMBER_OF_DONE_TASKS/TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_TASKS):
EMPLOYEE_NAME: name of the employee
NUMBER_OF_DONE_TASKS: number of completed tasks
TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_TASKS: total number of tasks, which is the sum of completed and non-completed tasks
Second and N next lines display the title of completed tasks: TASK_TITLE (with 1 tabulation and 1 space before the TASK_TITLE)
